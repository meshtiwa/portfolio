        <h2>📜 About Me! 📜</h2>
        <p>
         Hey yall! I am a Computer Engineering major at UCSC planning on doing a systems programming concentration. 
          My goals lie in wanting to apply software technologies to other fields, whether it's music, social good, business, and more! 
          In the tech field, I want to apply this knowledge to unorthodox industries and automate tedious processes!
        </p>

        <p>
         For fun, I love to integrate technologies into wacky applications of life. Right now, I am working on an application that combines
          web development and fitness (so stay tuned for that!).
          Aside from programming, I love to lift heavy weights at the gym and see its positive impact on my mental state and physical well-being. Additionally, I am always
          trying to spend my time trying new things, like DJing, concert festivals (Rolling Loud is my favorite), and meeting new people. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are some random facts about me: I like to DJ different genres together, my favorite house artist is Knock2, my favorite anime is One Piece☠️, and I like to put Sriracha on everything non-sweet🌶️.

        <h1>𖧋 CircleRush 𖧋</h1>
        <p1>
          As part of my undegraduate capstone (CSE 115A), 4 others and I created a competitive todo list application that allows people to keep each other accountable for tasks. We wanted to take a creative spin on the traditional "todo" list app, as these apps aren't always effective. Stack was decided by me, where we went with React Native and Expo CLI for the front-end, and connecting it with Firebase/Firestore, in which we utilized cloud functions for communicating with the SendGrid API to receive todo list notifications.

        <h3>🚚Amazon🚚</h3>
        <p>
          (Summer 2024) As an SDE Intern for the Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) group, I was working in the Inventory Planning Control (IPC) sector. I automated the development process for the next generation of Amazon’s inventory planning program “Just-In-Time”, which is responsible for 76% of the submitted retail purchase orders at Amazon. I also increased productivity for the development of Amazon’s predictive procurement services “SUP” by creating a set of CI/CD pipeline practices to follow org-wide using alarms, rollbacking, approval workflows, and monitors. Another cool thing I did was I added reliability and a faster testing process by utilizing Hydra test execution system, S3, and SQS to increase integration and load test coverage for faster and more efficient deployment process into production.
        </p>
        <h3>🔵Intel Corporation (Engineering Computing)🔵</h3>
        <p>
          (October 2023 - June 2024) As an intern for the Engineering Computing Group @ Intel, I oversaw the development of a project enablement microservice through React.js, Chakra UI, GraphQL, and Redux with 1 other person. While doing that, I maintained a pipeline via custom Intel API “Swiss” and back-end with Ruby on Rails. Overall, I was automating solutions for business problems through managing/developing microservice applications through test case creation, regression testing in Python, and scripting through Linux, MongoDB, and SQL.
        </p>
        <h3>🟪Yahoo Finance🟪</h3>
        <p>
          (Summer 2023) Working to serve 93 million users, I operate on designing the UI and functionality for the homepage of Yahoo Finance, where I am working on the new design system for Finance called "NEO" using Svelte.js. From referring to Figma designs, and making user-friendly design choices, I always try to make reliable and minimalistic design choices and implement them with optimized code. From unit/functional testing, to functionality implementation, and to design implementation to HTML/CSS designs, we stay organized with our workflow using JIRA management software, and use a wide variety of team-wide practices that include consistent coloring, formatting, commenting of code, and more. As an Intern, I am working on a feature bar that displays top headlined news, where I have to fetch data from an API and display it on the homepage.
        </p>
        <h3>🔵Intel Corporation (Optane)🔵</h3>
        <p>
          (February 2022 - September 2022) As part of the IOG (Optane group) business team, I help create microservice applications for automating tasks for other Optane groups through Angular, C#, and MySQL. Being part of this team has helped me to understand the structure of fullstack apps, and how the backend and frontend work!
        </p>
        <h3>😊Tech4Good (Research lab in UCSC)😊</h3>
        <p>
          Under Professor David Lee, I worked in a research lab where I could make technology for social good. As a Web Developer, I helped implement designs into actual code based on Figma designs. From this, I learned many crucial skills in web development such as styling formatting, and Git tools. Now, I am working on the "Containers" team where I utilize RxJs and Angular Store to retreive data from the database (Firestore), and make it easier for UI teams to bind the data.
